# Iocaste

Academic problem solvers' programming language

## Ideas

- Int type with range (like `Int [0 < _ < 1000]`) using Refinement Type System
- Linear Type System
- Specialized input/output statement
- Easy visualization
- Easy time-complexity evaluation from code
- [latexify](https://github.com/google/latexify_py)


## Goals

- [ ] Produce C++ codes from Iocaste codes
- [ ] Run Iocaste on Jupyter Notebook (make sense because Iocaste is a retrograde irregular satellite of Jupiter)

## Designs

- Fast as C++
- Powerful Utilities for
  - String algorithms, regex
  - biginteger (with fft for multiplication support)/bigdecimal on the fly
  - Geometric operations
